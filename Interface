/*points to remember about interface*/
//Interface is a fully abstract class
//In interface all the methods by default are public abstract
//In interface we can allow to declare constants only
// We are allowed to create a reference variable to Interface but it is not possible to create instance
//The class which implements an interface,it must be give the definitions for all the methods which are declared inside interface otherwise that class will be treated as abstract class
//Interface are used to hide the some of the services of the implemented class
